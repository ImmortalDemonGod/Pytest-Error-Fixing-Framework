# Pytest-Fixer Quality & Resilience Audit

**Auditor:** `[Your Name/Handle Here]`
**Date Started:** `[Date]`

This document contains the findings of a comprehensive code audit of the `pytest-fixer` repository. Its purpose is to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement in architecture, code quality, resilience, documentation, and testing.

## Audit Findings

*Use the table below to log your findings as you discover them. Add new rows as needed.*

| Component      | Category          | Finding / Observation                                                                                                                       | Severity (Low/Med/High) | Recommendation                                                                                                                  |
| :------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AIManager`    | Error Handling    | If the AI returns malformed JSON, `_parse_response` raises a generic `ValueError`. This makes it hard for the orchestrator to know *why* it failed. | Medium                  | Create a new `ParsingError` subclass of `AIManagerError` and raise that instead.                                              |
| `README.md`    | Doc Alignment     | The quick-start guide is excellent but doesn't explicitly mention the need for a `.env` file to store the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.                       | High                    | Add a clear "Configuration" step that shows how to create the `.env` file.                                                      |
| *(Add your findings here)* | ...               | ...                                                                                                                                         | ...                     | ...                                                                                                                             |

## Component Audit Checklist

*Use this checklist to guide your exploration of the codebase. Check off items as you complete your analysis for that component.*

### I. Core Logic & Domain Integrity (`src/branch_fixer/core/`)

- [ ] **Domain Models (`models.py`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Are the aggregate/entity/value-object roles clear?
    -   **Code Quality:** Are the `to_dict`/`from_dict` methods comprehensive?
    -   **Resilience:** How are business rules enforced (e.g., preventing a fix on an already-fixed error)? Is `ErrorDetails` truly immutable?

### II. Application Orchestration & State Flow (`src/branch_fixer/orchestration/`)

- [ ] **Single-Error Workflow (`fix_service.py`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Trace the `attempt_fix` method. Does it correctly coordinate the different infrastructure services?
    -   **Resilience:** How are failures during the workflow handled? Is the backup/restore mechanism correctly invoked?
- [ ] **Multi-Error Workflow (`orchestrator.py`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Does the `FixOrchestrator` cleanly manage the `FixSession` lifecycle?
    -   **Code Quality:** Is the multi-retry logic (with temperature scaling) clear and easy to follow?

### III. Infrastructure Services & External Interactions (`src/branch_fixer/services/`)

- [ ] **AI Manager (`ai/manager.py`)**
    -   **Resilience:** How are LLM API errors (e.g., timeouts, key errors) and malformed responses handled?
    -   **Code Quality:** Is the prompt construction logic clear? Is the response parsing robust?
- [ ] **Code Applier (`code/change_applier.py`)**
    -   **Resilience:** Is the backup-and-restore mechanism safe and atomic? What happens if the backup or restore operation itself fails?
    -   **Code Quality:** Is the syntax validation (`compile()`) sufficient for its purpose?
- [ ] **Git Repository (`git/`)**
    -   **Resilience:** Are `subprocess` and `GitPython` errors handled gracefully and wrapped in custom exceptions?
    -   **Code Quality:** Is the state management clean (i.e., does the tool reliably return the user to their original branch)?
- [ ] **Pytest Runner (`pytest/`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Review `runner.py`. Is the data capture via the custom plugin robust?
    -   **Code Quality:** Review `error_processor.py`. Is the mapping from a `SessionResult` to domain `TestError`s complete and correct?

### IV. Persistence, State, and Recovery (`src/branch_fixer/storage/`)

- [ ] **Session Storage (`session_store.py`)**
    -   **Resilience:** How does the store handle a missing or corrupt `sessions.json` file?
    -   **Code Quality:** Are all `FixSession` fields correctly serialized and deserialized?
- [ ] **State Machine (`state_manager.py`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Is the state machine logic correctly enforcing valid transitions?

### V. Test Suite Quality (`tests/`)

- [ ] **Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)**
    -   **Test Quality:** Do tests cover edge cases and error conditions, or just the happy path? Are mocks used effectively?
- [ ] **Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)**
    -   **Test Quality:** Do the tests cover key interactions between layers (e.g., `Orchestrator` -> `Service` -> `AIManager`)?
- [ ] **Test Infrastructure (`tests/fixtures/` and `tests/conftest.py`)**
    -   **Code Quality:** Are the fixtures easy to understand and use? Do they set up and tear down state reliably?

### VI. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] **Configuration & CLI (`utils/run_cli.py` and `utils/cli.py`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** How are configuration settings propagated through the system?
    -   **Resilience:** Is user input validated? How are CLI-level errors reported?
- [ ] **Logging (`config/logging_config.py`)**
    -   **Documentation Alignment:** Do log messages provide a clear and useful trace of the application's execution? Are there any potential secrets being logged?
- [ ] **Dependencies (`pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`)**
    -   **Architectural Consistency:** Are the dependencies well-chosen? Are there any that seem unnecessary?
