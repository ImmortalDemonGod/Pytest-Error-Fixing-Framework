üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: The code changes we introduced add **session-awareness**, **state-management**, and **recovery** capabilities, so the execution flow is more robust and trackable. This means your fix workflow no longer just ‚Äúdoes the fix‚Äù and exits; instead, it follows a structured session (with start, run, and end states). Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how each major change affects the runtime behavior:

[emoji]: **1. Session Awareness (SessionStore + FixSession)**  
- **Before:** The system would discover failing tests, run `FixService.attempt_fix`, and wrap up with no further record-keeping.  
- **After:** You create or load a `FixSession` that tracks the tests to be fixed, the current state, how many errors are fixed, etc. When the session is updated (e.g. an error is fixed, or something fails), the session object gets saved to the `SessionStore`.  
- **Effect:** You now have a persistent record of what was attempted, how many attempts were made, which errors were fixed, and whether the session ended successfully.

[emoji]: **2. State Management (StateManager)**  
- **Before:** The system had no notion of ‚Äústates‚Äù for a fix session: it was basically one shot.  
- **After:** We have transitions like `INITIALIZING ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. The `StateManager` ensures we only move between valid states and can log or persist those transitions.  
- **Effect:** If something goes wrong (e.g., a fix fails or an exception is raised), the system can transition the session to `FAILED` or `ERROR`, meaning you can see exactly what state the session ended in.

[emoji]: **3. Recovery Logic (RecoveryManager)**  
- **Before:** If something failed mid-fix, the code might revert the file via `ChangeApplier`, but there was no broader concept of rolling back the entire session or Git branch.  
- **After:** We optionally create ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù (snapshots) before certain steps (like each fix attempt), and if an exception or failure occurs, the orchestrator can call `handle_failure(...)` in the `RecoveryManager`. That triggers a restore from the last known checkpoint (or whichever logic you choose).  
- **Effect:** You can see more advanced rollback if an error breaks the session. Instead of leaving the repository in a half-broken state, you can revert to a safe checkpoint.

## How to Know It‚Äôs Working

1. **Check Session Flow in Logs**  
   - Run your CLI (e.g. `pytest-fixer fix --api-key=...` or whatever your main entry is).  
   - See in the logs whether a session got created, which state it transitioned to, how many tests were fixed, etc.  
   - You‚Äôll see lines like:  
     ```
     INFO: Session xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx started with 3 errors.
     INFO: Attempting to fix error: test_something
     INFO: Marked error test_something as fixed
     INFO: Session xxxxx completed
     ```  
   - If you see the ‚Äúsession completed‚Äù line, or ‚Äúsession paused‚Äù or ‚Äúsession failed,‚Äù it means the new logic is being used.

2. **Confirm Checkpoint Creation**  
   - By default, the new `RecoveryManager` writes JSON data about recovery points to a `recovery_points.json` (or similar) in your `backup_dir`.  
   - After you run the fix process, check whether that file exists and has appended `RecoveryPoint` entries. This confirms your system is actually creating checkpoints.

3. **Test a Failure Case**  
   - Deliberately create a test or fix scenario that fails (like rename a function so the AI fix fails or add a forced exception).  
   - See if the orchestrator calls `handle_error(...)`, tries a rollback, or sets `session.state = FixSessionState.ERROR`.  
   - Check logs for something like:  
     ```
     WARNING: Handling error: ...
     Attempting to restore last checkpoint ...
     Restore result: True
     ```
   - If you see that, you know your recovery flow is triggered.

4. **Look for Session Persistence**  
   - The `SessionStore` writes session data into a `sessions.json` (or your configured file).  
   - After the run, open that file. You should see session entries with a unique ID, states, or references to completed errors. That indicates your session logic is storing data as intended.

5. **Manual Testing**  
   - **Pause/Resume**: If you run with an interactive CLI, try pausing the session in the middle (where the code calls `pause_session()`). The logs and session store should reflect that the session state changed to `PAUSED`. Then resume it, and see if it transitions to `RUNNING`.  
   - **start_session** vs. **run_session**: If your CLI or test code calls `start_session` to create a session, then `run_session` to actually fix errors, watch the logs for the transition from `INITIALIZING` ‚Üí `RUNNING`.  

In short, **it‚Äôs working** if you can see sessions get created and ended in the correct states, see errors properly fixed or marked as failed, see checkpoints recorded in the JSON file, and watch the code revert to older states on an error.

üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: That‚Äôs the big picture. You‚Äôll see the difference mostly in the logs, the persistent `sessions.json`, and the `recovery_points.json` if something fails mid-fix.
======
üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Below is a **refined** command-line interface (CLI) proposal that addresses several usability and edge-case concerns. The goal is to give the user clearer instructions, handle unexpected conditions gracefully, and provide more robust interactive prompts.

[emoji]: We‚Äôll *highlight changes* that help navigate the program more smoothly, give better context messages to the user, and consider edge cases (e.g., no failing tests found, repeated failures, or partial fixes).


### Key Refinements

1. **More Informative Prompts**  
   - We display the file path, test function name, error type, and a brief message. This helps the user know exactly what needs fixing.  

2. **Better Branch & PR Logic**  
   - If the user decides not to create a PR, we still treat the fix attempt as ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù (the test is fixed), even if we skip the PR step.  

3. **Enhanced Edge-Case Handling**  
   - If the user selects ‚ÄúQuit,‚Äù we break out of the loop and skip the rest of the test errors.  
   - If a branch creation fails, we catch the exception but log a warning and allow continuing if that suits the scenario.  

4. **Improved Manual Fix Workflow**  
   - We repeatedly prompt the user to see if they want to keep trying or skip.  
   - Logging clarifies the difference between partial success (test is still failing) and skip.  

5. **Interactive vs. Non-Interactive Mode**  
   - In non-interactive mode, no prompts are given; we default to an AI-based fix attempt.  

6. **More Granular Logging**  
   - We show exactly which step we‚Äôre on (branch creation, fix attempt, PR creation).  
   - All exceptions are caught, and if `DEBUG` is enabled, we show the traceback in logs.

### Testing & Verifying the CLI

1. **Run**:  
   ```bash
   pytest-fixer fix --api-key="..." --test-path="tests/" --test-function="..." --non-interactive
   ```  
   or  
   ```bash
   pytest-fixer fix --api-key="..." --test-path="tests/" 
   ```  
   The second version prompts you step by step for each failing test.

2. **Observe**:  
   - Check that you get clear ‚Äúfail, skip, or success‚Äù messages for each test.  
   - Confirm any branches/PR creation steps appear in logs or on the console.  
   - If something fails (e.g., can‚Äôt push to remote), ensure the user sees a descriptive error message.  

3. **Edge Cases**:  
   - No failing tests. (Should quickly say ‚ÄúAll tests passed, no fixes needed!‚Äù)  
   - Single failing test. (Prompt once or fix automatically in non-interactive mode.)  
   - Large number of tests (verify that the loop processes each test systematically).  
   - User hits Ctrl-C mid-fix or a kill signal: The code calls `setup_signal_handlers()` and cleans up.  

This refined CLI design ensures the user has enough context for each step, plus explicit instructions on how to proceed.
