REFACTOR:    
=======
The major types of code refactoring mentioned include:

1. **Extract Function**: Extracting code into a function or method (also referred to as Extract Method).
2. **Extract Variable**: Extracting code into a variable.
3. **Inline Function**: The inverse of Extract Function, where a function is inlined back into its calling code.
4. **Inline Variable**: The inverse of Extract Variable, where a variable is inlined back into its usage.
5. **Change Function Declaration**: Changing the names or arguments of functions.
6. **Rename Variable**: Renaming variables for clarity.
7. **Encapsulate Variable**: Encapsulating a variable to manage its visibility.
8. **Introduce Parameter Object**: Combining common arguments into a single object.
9. **Combine Functions into Class**: Grouping functions with the data they operate on into a class.
10. **Combine Functions into Transform**: Merging functions particularly useful with read-only data.
11. **Split Phase**: Organizing modules into distinct processing phases.

These refactorings focus on improving code clarity and maintainability without altering its observable behavior.
